Largely inspired by stedekay's SpraedPDFGenerator - https://github.com/stedekay/SpraedPDFGenerator

This is a simple HTML to PDF converter, written in Java.

Based on itext 2.0.8
Using jtidy to clean HTML

The improvements consist in using a socket to launch a thread each time a client connects to the server.
Sending HTML content results in the server sending back a PDF file on the socket.

The PDF generated is outputed directly to the socket, so you must take care of it.

It's also possible to use it in a simple STDIN / STDOUT mode without launching a server.

Usage
=====

Launching a server :
java -jar pdfgenerator.jar --encoding UTF-8 --host localhost --port 9191

STDIN/STDOUT mode :
java -jar pdfgenerator.jar --encoding UTF-8 < file.html > file.pdf
